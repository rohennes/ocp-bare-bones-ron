You can install {product-title} on on-premise hardware or on-premise VMs using the {ai-full}. The {ai-full} provides you with more options for customization than an installer-provisioned installation, while still running pre-flight validations and using smart defaults.

Installing {product-title} using the {ai-full} supports both x86-64 and arm64 CPU architectures.

[id="assisted-installer-api-support-policy"]
== API support for the {ai-full}
